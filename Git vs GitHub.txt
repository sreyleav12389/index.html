Git

Git is a tool for version control. It keeps track of every change in your code.

You can experiment safely, knowing you can revert to an earlier version anytime.

Commands you’ll often use:

git init → start a new repository

git add . → stage all changes

git commit -m "message" → save a snapshot

git status → see the current state of your project

GitHub

GitHub is an online service where you can host Git repositories.

It allows collaboration with others and sharing your projects.

Features to know:

Clone: copy a repo to your computer

Push: upload your changes

Pull: download updates from others

Pull request: propose changes to a project

How They Work Together

Use Git locally to track changes.

Use GitHub to back up your code online and collaborate.

Typical workflow:

Make changes locally → git add → git commit

Send changes to GitHub → git push

Update your local repo from GitHub → git pull

Key Idea:
Git is the engine that manages your code history, while GitHub is the platform where you can share, collaborate, and showcase your work.
